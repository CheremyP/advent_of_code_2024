# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 - Rust ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2023! In this repository, I'll be sharing my daily solutions to the coding challenges using the Rust programming language.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
- You have read the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) rules and understand the challenge format.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar). It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private [leaderboards](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard).

## Repository Structure

- **dayOne:**
  - [Day 1 Solution](./day1)
    - [main.rs](./day1/src/main.rs): Rust code for solving the Day 1 puzzle.
    - [input.txt](./day1/input.txt): Puzzle input for Day 1.

- **dayTwo:**
  - [Day 2 Solution](./day2)
    - [main.rs](./day2/src/main.rs): Rust code for solving the Day 2 puzzle.
    - [input.txt](./day2/input.txt): Puzzle input for Day 2.
... (repeat for each day)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CheremyP/AdventofCode2023_Rust.git
   cd AdventOfCode2023-Rust
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific day's folder (e.g., dayOne) to view the solution code and input.
3. Run the Rust code using cargo 
``` bash
cd dayOne
cargo run
```
4. The output will be the solution to that day's challenge.
   
Enjoy the code and happy coding!
